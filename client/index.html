As Production Manager at Arabian Radio Network in Dubai, I've worked with many voiceover talents, and her voice always brings scripts to life – fun, fresh, exciting, upbeat, and full of personality. Even working with her remotely, her recordings make production smooth and spots get approved quickly. I would happily work with her again."
